# ScientificWriting
This is the repo for scientific writing.

It shall give you an idea on how to write reports on Case Studies on the LFC Cham for topics that are handed out by Prof. Weber.

There are many way on how to do Case Study reports as well as Thesis on a technical basis. 
One rule of thumb does apply: The content matters more than the means of how you arrive at the final report.

By adhering to those guidelines you make it easier for everyone to read, and finally grade, your papers.

# Structure

In general, you must comply to the following structure:

1) Introduction
2) Materials and Methods
3) Results
4) Discussion

Those four chapters are the last structure you will need in your life in order to do technical writing.
There is no technical/engineering/scientific writing topic on the face of this earth, that does not use this structure in one way or another.

The chapters can be appended by two (not so) optional chapters:

5) References
6) Appendix

Not all engineering/technical/scientific wirting scenarios include an appendix. 
Usually, they do include references.

## Introduction

- describes the state of the art
- includes a literature research 
- identifies the research question based on the literature research
- the last paragraph/the last sentence *always* contains the actual research question at which you arrive

> [!Tip]
> Write the introduction *after* you finished (except for the literature review). This way it is easier to formulate the research question.

## Materials and Methods

- describes what you did
- describes what you used
- do not include results in this section
- show how and where the method was verified (if needed)
- you do not need to explain all methods in detail, you can cite the respective paper - but show where your approach may differ

>[!Tip]
> The materials and methods section can always be written during the actual work on the project.

## Results

- describes only the results
- no interpretations in the results section
- will be boring, but is necessary
- if you have figures of the same type it is enough to describe the results in the figure once and put repeated figures in the appendix
- do not repeat parts of the introduction or the M&M section

>[!Tip]
> The results are *just* reported, do **NOT** interprate the results in the results section.

## Discussion

- is the heart of your actual paper
- is where you can get creative
- consists of the following sub-strucutre
  1) short repetition of the research question in the introduction
  2) discussion of the results, connecting the dots
  3) strengths and limitations: there are **ALWAYS** strengths and limitations in **EVERY** study. If none are reported and discussed, it actually decreases the quality of your paper. Discuss how the limitations impact or may imopact the results and report either counter actions you took or report some that are possible.
