# ScientificWriting
This is the repo for scientific writing.

It shall give you an idea on how to write reports on Case Studies on the LFC Cham for topcis that are handed out by Prof. Weber.

There are many way on how to do Case Study reports as well as Thesis on a technical basis. 
One rule of thumb does apply: The content matters more than the means of how you arrive at the final report.

By adhering to those guidelines you make it easier for everyone to read, and finally grade, your papers.

# Structure

In general, you must comply to the following structure:

1) Introduction
2) Materials and Methods
3) Results
4) Discussion

Those four chapters are the last structure you will need in your life in order to do technical writing.
There is no technical/engineering/scientific writing topic on the face of this earth, that does not use this structure in one way or another.

The chapters can be appended by two (not so) optional chapters:

5) References
6) Appendix

Not all engineering/technical/scientific wirting scenarios include an appendix. 
Usually, they do include references.

## Introduction

- describes the state of the art
- includes a literature research 
- identifies the research question based on the literature research
- the last paragraph/the last sentence *always* contains the actual research question at which you arrive
